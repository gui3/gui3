# Hi !

I am an amateur developper and musician/producer.

Along with this README
(will come) the sources of my new personal website,
which you can visit for further information
and much funny games,
at [**gui3.fr** (! not yet https)](https://gui3.fr)

## gui3.fr

For now, this address point you to my old website,
which is ... unfinished and yanky.

I made it with the [Sapper framework](https://sapper.svelte.dev/)
which (i love whiches) which is on the way to be [deprecated](https://sapper.svelte.dev/faq#version-numbers) in favor of *not yet production-ready* [svelteKit](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit)

Because of this,
and because my old website is a joyfull mess,
I decided to jump off that tree and start from fresh.

Here is all I can say for now, there are miles to go,
but I'm gonna make it.
