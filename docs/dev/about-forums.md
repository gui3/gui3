research on the best way to embed a forum for free

## github discuss solutions

> best to keep everything on github

## discord solutions

> for free easy discussion and notifications

$$$ CUSTOM:
my preferred choice,
make a discord bot, host it on glitch,
then get data through fetch.

Discord Widget :
useless
only displays channel names and connect button

Titan :
need to add a bot to the channel
why not ?

Widgetbot:
to be seen, free plan




## slack solutions

> if not discord, why not slack ?


## google drive solution

> maybe google has something
> in exchange for big data

## social networks solutions

Twitter:
why not?

Facebook:
bad idea

## other solutions

### hosted

https://nabble.com/
completely free embeddable forum ...
this is too great, there must be a problem,
and i believe it's in privacy policy.

https://tribe.so/embed-forum-on-website
free plan up to 500 members

### self-hosted

> if there is no other solution,
> why not a heroku server with test database
> and self hosted solution

Discourse
hosted = expensive but free if self hosted (open source)
really good looking
